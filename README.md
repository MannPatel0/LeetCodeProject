# LeetCode Patterns

A website designed to help LeetCode users track and manage their progress across 174 curated problems, inspired by:  
- [Curated List of Top 75 LeetCode Questions to Save Your Time](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU)  
- [Sean Prasad's LeetCode Patterns](https://www.seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)

## Motivation Behind the Website

After completing questions on Sean Prasad's site, I found it tedious to manually update my progress by clicking the checklist for each question. This inspired me to improve upon his design by integrating the GraphQL API to automatically track and update the status of completed questions.  

### Current Features
- Automated progress tracking via GraphQL API.  

### Future Plans
- Update the documentation to explain how the integration works once I have more time.  
- If traffic increases, I plan to add minimal advertisements to cover operational costs.  

Check out the website and stay tuned for updates. Thank you for your support!
